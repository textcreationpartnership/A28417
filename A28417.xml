            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Perſon, whoſe Name (for his Relations ſake, which are very Conſiderable) we omit, as not thinking it convenient to add ſorrow to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, living in a Village near <hi>Comb</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> having a conſiderable time ſince Marryed a handſome young Woman, with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Fortune; they in the beginning of their Marriage ſtate lived together both very happy and comfortably, and had divers hopeful Children, which were brought up with Care and good Education, their Parents providing very plentifully for them, and by the Bleſſing of God, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their endeavours, the Subſtance ſtill encreaſed; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that they had what they could deſire to render a happy ſatisfaction in temporal things; but in the height

of theſe Enjoyments and Poſſeſſion, the Devil put in to overturn their peace and quiet, and ſo far exerted his powerful Temptations, that he utterly unhinged their felicity, in ſtirring up Jealouſies and Miſtruſts between the Man and his Wife, ſo that heart-burnings and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities brought in quarrels and ſtrife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon Notice of this ſudden Alteration in a Family which had ſo long lived peaceably, ſome honeſt Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours undertoook the good Office of reconciling them to their former good underſtanding, but it continued not long, e're the Fire that ſeemed to glimmer in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, broke out again into a violent Flame, whether cauſed by the unhappy Husband's being jealous of his handſome Wife, (perhaps without a cauſe) unexpected Loſs, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments in buſineſs, ſince it yet remains in the dark, we determine not, but certain it is, Coming home on <hi>Fryday</hi> the 30th. of <hi>March</hi> laſt, ſooner than his Wife ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, ſhe upon viewing his Countenance fiery, ſtern and furious more than uſual, dreading the fatal Conſequence, ſtarted up and fled out of his reach, being too nimble for him, though he was not ſlow in purſuing her a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable way, but ſhe getting ſhelter in a Neighbours houſe, he declined his purſuit and went home, raging and ſtorming in an extraordinary diſcompoſed manner.</p>
            <p>This diſorder made ſome of the Neigbours follow him at a diſtance, in hopes to pacifie him when the heat of his fury was a little abated, as they having been formerly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his temper. But now the Power of Darkneſs was ſtronger with him than ever, for in his return, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his only Son (a Lad about 12. years of Age) who came out of the Houſe, with uplifted hands and tears, to intreat him to be pacified, and not to kill or beat his Mother; he putting off all bowels of Pity and Compaſſion, ſnatched up a Mattock, an Inſtrument uſed in felling Trees, and Barbarouſly at one Forcible Blow Clove his Head in ſunder, whileſt the Lad (perceiving his revengeful intent) kneeled before his Inhuman Father to beg his pity, <hi>Intreating him to ſpare his Life.</hi>

This appeaſed not his Diabolick Fury, but ſmeered with the Blood and Brains which daſhed in his Face upon the ſtroak to upbraid his Impiety, he went into his houſe with the bloody Inſtrument in his hand, &amp; there finding his three Daughters (the Eldeſt not exceeding 9. years) crying at the danger they ſuppoſed their Mother in, he made furiouſly towards them, which cauſed them to fly into an inner room, but without any remorſe purſuing them, he, whileſt they were on their knees, with uplifted hands, Crying <hi>Father, Father, pray don't kill us, and we will be good Children,</hi> beat out (which I tremble to relate) their brains, with the bloody Inſtrument he had killed their Brother with, a little before,</p>
            <p>Immediately upon this, the Divine Power ſtruck him with remorſe, as he hath ſince Confeſſed, ſo that he ſtood fixed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and amazed, viewing the bloody ruines his fury and diſpair had prompted him to make on the Bodies of the Children of his bowels; which forced a flood of tears from his Eyes; whereupon he fell to taring his hair, and his cloaths, Curſing the day he was born, as in a kind of a diſtraction and diſpaire, and the temptation urging him, eſpying a Rope, he ſnatcht it up, and ſought for a place to fix it to and hang himſelf; but in the mean time, the Neighbours who had ſeen at a diſtance the firſt tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal act, came ruſtling in and prevented it. His Wife likewiſe dreading the Fatal Conſequence, came haſtily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, and ſeeing her Children weltring in their blood, and ſhreiking out in a Lamentable manner, She ſunk down on their dying Bodies in a deadly Swoon, but with much chafing was recovered, but at the coming away of this Relation, ſhe remained ſpeechleſs, diſtracted, and in little likelyhood of living long.</p>
            <p>The Bloody Husband being carried before a Juſtice of Peace, in a Raving, and Diſtracted manner, Confeſſed the the ſeveral Murthers, and ſaid, <hi>The Devil had tempted him to Murther his Fanily, and at that time he could not reſiſt the temptation, but now was ſorry for it with a bleeding heart and wiſhed it undone.</hi>
